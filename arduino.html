						   <h3><b>How does the Home Automation work?</b></h3></br>
							-Simple Home Automation works between smart phone, internet and microcontroller which help  in transmitting the power to the different appliances.</br> 

							-The Microcontroller <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Arduino-ATmega328P-Cable-length-feet/dp/B06XBMB9T1/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1552040585&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=arduino+uno&psc=1"> (Arduino UNO Board)</a> is a chip which transmits the data and work under specified instruction.</br>
							-<a href="https://www.amazon.in/DIY-Retails-Bluetooth-Transceiver-Outputs/dp/B019OR9YVU?tag=googinhydr18418-21&tag=googinkenshoo-21&ascsubtag=_k_CjwKCAiAwojkBRBbEiwAeRcJZDUD-cCe-X0_5t3WXUHUcNExvsmtMxK2xZfsl3AtvSY54l9C7eZu8hoC6lYQAvD_BwE_k_&gclid=CjwKCAiAwojkBRBbEiwAeRcJZDUD-cCe-X0_5t3WXUHUcNExvsmtMxK2xZfsl3AtvSY54l9C7eZu8hoC6lYQAvD_BwE">Bluetooth module(HC-05)</a>  is used to connect the smartphone and the arduino board to give commands.</br>
							-Bluetooth module is controlled by the bluetooth application in smartphone which is available on playstore and we can make one of our own with personal configuration on <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/#"> MIT app inventor.</a></br>

							<h4><b>EXECUTION</b></h4>

							Research:-</br>

							-After collecting all the components i started my research for the project.</br>
							-There are many projects available on internet showing us many different methods but  all their aim is samen to automate their home.</br>
							-I started with the search of controlling the light with bluetooth and relay directly. Which i found very difficult to understand.</br>
							-After few trials in which i failed to complete the circuit i decided to separate two parts of the project in which i first made the LED blink with bluetooth and then blink LED with bluetooth and relay.</br>
							-After many research and failed attempts to find the correct video,i asked for help to my friend maharshi and he gave me one link of the video which i found very helpful. You can find the link <a href="https://youtu.be/TZnrHkjlgLk"> here.</a></br>

							Prototyping:-</br>

							<h3>Step:1</h3>
							-After watching few videos and surfing some website i made one schematic diagram of  the circuit i needed which could be helpful to understand the system.</br>
							-This is my trial of the first half in which i controlled LED with the help of bluetooth.</br>
							-You can find the source code and other information on this project in the below given <a href="https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-and-hc-05-bluetooth-module-tutorial/">link.</a></br>					
							-Now i can blink led through mobile.</br>

<img src="images/documentation/arduino/5.jpg" alt="poster" style="width:400px"></br></br>


							<h3>Step:2</h3>
							-After the success of this i connected relay to blink the led with command from serial monitor just to be sure of the working of relay with turning lights on/off.</br>
							-Below you can find the picture of my relay model and connections as well.</br>
</style>
</head>
<body>
<img src="images/documentation/arduino/6.jpg" alt="poster" style="width:400px"></br></br>
							-Connect Int(relay) pin with Digital pin7.</br>
							-GND & VCC to GND & +5V of arduino board respectively.</br>
							-Connect +ve of 9V battery to common port of Relay and -v of battery to led.</br>
							-Connect NC port of Relay and +ve leg of LED.</br>





							<h3>Step:3 <b>(Combining both the circuits)</b></h3>
							-Now as the main aim was to control LED with bluetooth i connected both the circuits.</br>
							- Components you need for this - Arduino, Bluetooth(HC-05), 5v relay, jumper cables, B-Type usb, 9V battery.</br>

							<h3>Step:4  <b>Make the circuit work with home appliance</b></h3>
							-Now was the hard part in which i had to connect the 240V AC supply of house to my circuit.</br>
							-After the design i just started to open the switchboard of my house to look into it for wire connections, how they are connected with each other and how will i connect my model with it.</br>

<img src="images/documentation/arduino/11.jpg" alt="poster" style="width:400px"></br></br> 			            
							-This in process was a failure for me. I didnâ€™t understood anything and all the process done went in vain.</br>
							-For that i took help from my friend Maharshi and my Mentor Tapan sir. All they did was just to guide me to the right direction in which i did research about the colour codes of wire and found the simple design of connecting those wires to the relay.</br>
							-Below is the circuit diagram for the final prototype working on 240V AC supply and controlling light through bluetooth.</br>
							-You can get the link i referred for connection <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/15454/how-to-connect-relay-and-physical-switch-to-control-light"> here.</a></br>

							-And here is my final working prototype image.</br>

							<h3>Step:5 <b>(GSM based home automation.)</b></h3>
							            
</style>
</head>
<body>
<img src="images/documentation/arduino/14.png" alt="poster" style="width:400px"></br></br>							     
							-Now there was a modification in my task. I had to make the same home automation work with the help of GSM module.</br>
							-GSM based automation means that you can control your home appliances from thousands of miles away. You just have to send a text message with appropriate command and the electricity will turn ON/OFF.</br>
							
							Difficulties:-</br>
							-First problem was that it was not detecting the sim card. I Just tried like 5 to 6 times removing the sim card and inserting it again and again but  nothing happened.</br>
							-Then after asking to my friend i got to know that the module cannot detect the 4G sim card, it is feasible uptill 2G/3G only. And there was a little mistake i made (starting out the project without research)</br>
							-You can simply check if the card is working in the module by calling on the number.</br>


							Trials:-</br>
							-After simplifying the starting problem i ran the code to send a text message from GSM module to the desired  mobile number.</br>
							-You can check whole process from this <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Interfacing-SIM900A-GSM-Modem-with-Arduino/"> link.</a></br>

							<h3>Step:6 <b>(connecting GSM with Relay)</b></h3>
							-Components required</br>
							  Arduino UNO,</br>
							   GSM sim800a,</br>
							    12V dc supply for GSM module, </br>
							    relay bulb connection same as used in Bluetooth.</br>

</head>
<body>
<img src="images/documentation/arduino/16.jpg" alt="poster" style="width:600px"></br></br>
							-As i already did the circuit with Bluetooth and relay doing this was quite simple. I just Searched for the code online and applied it to</br>
							- Here is the link for automation with <a href="https://alselectro.wordpress.com/2018/04/06/gsm-controlled-relay-with-arduino/">GSM and Relay.</a> </br>

<img src="images/documentation/arduino/19.jpg" alt="poster" style="width:300px"></br></br>
							<h3>Step:7</h3> 
								-Now the hardest task was to control the voltage/ current flow.</br>
							-With this we can regulate the speed of fan or change the brightness of light as per we wanted.</br>
							-So i started my research but did not found any proper material to which i can refer for my project.</br>
							-After investing lots of my time on research i called up Tapan sir and he got me a name of component which could be helpful for me on the project.</br>
</style>
</head>
<body>
<img src="images/documentation/arduino/20.JPG" alt="poster" style="width:400px"></br></br>
							-â€™TRIACâ€™ was the component and with that i found one video on youtube in which they explained whole process and thus i carried the same method with my project. </br>
							-You can see the video from this <a href="https://youtu.be/QYUcXIhxL1I"> link.</a></br>
							-After watching the video i listed down all the components used in circuit making and writing the properties of each one of them.</br>
</style>
</head>
<body>
<img src="images/documentation/arduino/21.jpg" alt="poster" style="width:600px"></br></br>
							-Then i bought all the components required because i was not having the one which the circuit wanted. (i.e 47K ohm resistors, TRIAC, DIAC, Optocoupler, 4 circuit rectifier)</br>
</style>
</head>
<body>
<img src="images/documentation/arduino/22.jpg" alt="poster" style="width:600px"></br></br>

							<h3>Step:8</h3>
							-I started making of circuit by watching the video. Placed the components one by one and connecting them to each other with the help of jumper cables.</br>
							-In result i ended up having the complex circuit.</br>

							Failure:-</br>
							-Yes clearly this one was a big failure for me. Though i completed the circuit by myself as the data were not given properly.</br>

							-While trying the circuit for the first time firstly the light intensity was not being low/high when i rotated the potentiometer but instead of the fluctuation the 10K PWM got burned.</br>
							-Then i used another PWM of 470k which also got burned due to direct high voltage of 240V AC current.</br>
							-After constantly working for 2 days on research i was still not able to make the speed regulation work.</br>
</style>
</head>
<body>
<img src="images/documentation/arduino/25.jpg" alt="poster" style="width:600px"></br></br>



							Final Research about the failure:-</br>
							-I found that the speed regulation circuit for such high AC power supply cannot be done on breadboard. Special PCB needs to be designed for this purpose.</br>
							-I found new schematic diagram through my friend of this field for the circuit and compared it with the old one i used.</br>
</style>
</head>
<body>
<img src="images/documentation/arduino/26.jpg" alt="poster" style="width:600px"></br></br>
							-I need to design the PCB which i have to learn and collect proper components for the circuit and try once again.</br>
							- Another problem i discovered with my self assessment was that, if we detach the given switch of home and connect it to our circuit.</br></br>
							Q:- What if your mobile went off? The bluetooth application is not working? The network of the sim card you are using is down?</br>
							Sol:- We can use the touch IC and place it in the place if old switch so when there is some kind of problem arises we can manually control the system.</br></br>

							Working Video of my Project:-</br>
							Model 1- <a href="https://youtu.be/mMbOUeWiunI"> Bluetooth Controlled Home Automation.</a></br>
							Model 2-<a href="https://youtu.be/7TEElHTnWRI"> GSM module controlled Home automation.</a>
